      I'm David Umiri, a Web Application Developer passionate about functional and well-designed solutions. My core skills include proficiency in modern technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and Java, as well as frameworks such as Vue.js and Spring Boot. I have worked with the WordPress CMS in several projects, which has allowed me to acquire a comprehensive view of the web development lifecycle, from conception to implementation and maintenance.
